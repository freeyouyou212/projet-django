The file /iut-orsay-internship-portal/iut-orsay-internship-portal/static/vendor/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css is typically a minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework. Since I cannot provide the actual content of the Bootstrap library, I will indicate that this file should be populated with the minified CSS code from Bootstrap.

Please download the latest version of Bootstrap from the official Bootstrap website and place the contents in this file. 

For now, I will leave a comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank for you to fill in with the appropriate content.
